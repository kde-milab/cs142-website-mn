# Mongolian version of ICSI301 website
This is Mongolian translation version of [ICSI301 Web Applications](https://ICSI301.stanford.edu/) course website offered by Stanford University. 
This translation is alternative material for ICSI301 Web Application course at the National University of Mongolia (NUM) that follows the ICSI301.

Thanks for professor Mendel Rosenblum who allows us to use his course materials for the NUM course.
